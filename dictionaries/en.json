                "question": "What type of battery is used in your device?",
                "answer": "It uses a high-quality lithium-polymer battery with a total capacity of 50 ampere-hours, 12.6 volts."
            },

                "question": "What devices can be connected to the AC output port of this device?",
                "answer": "The AC output port, with a rated power of 250W and a peak power of 500W, can power a portion of household appliances. We recommend checking the power of the appliances first and ensuring that the total power of all connected devices under load is below the rated power."
            },
            {
                "question": "How can I tell how much charge is left in the device?",
                "answer": "The battery level indicator shows the current battery charge. If no segment of the indicator is lit but the indicator itself is active - that is, illuminated, it is recommended to recharge the charging station."
            },
            {
                "question": "Under what conditions can the PUPS charging station be used?",
                "answer": "The charging station is designed for use in harsh conditions, including military operations and extreme situations. It is suitable for use in any weather, but its use during rain or snow should be avoided. If water gets inside the station, it is recommended to immediately turn off all switches, open the case, and dry the internal components."
            },
            {
                "question": "What should I do if a component of the station fails?",
                "answer": "If there are problems with the operation of any port or switch, we recommend contacting us to arrange for repair. Attempting to fix the problem yourself is not advisable. We applied a modular principle in manufacturing, which means only the damaged component can be replaced without needing to repair the entire device."
            },
            {
                "question": "What is the recommended storage environment for the charging station?",
                "answer": "The optimal place for storing the charging station is in a room with a temperature of 18 to 20 degrees Celsius. If the station has not been used for a long time, it should be fully charged before the next use."
            },
            {
                "question": "What should I do if the inverter turns off and the charging station stops working under load?",
                "answer": "If the charging station suddenly turns off, it may indicate that it was overloaded. In such a case, first turn off all switches and disconnect all connected devices. Then, you can turn the relevant functionality back on, ensuring that the total power of the connected appliances does not exceed the inverter's allowable power."
